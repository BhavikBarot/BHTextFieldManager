# BHTextFieldManager
Often while developing an app the iPhone keyboard slide up and cover the `UITextField/UITextView`. `BHTextFieldManager` allows you to prevent issues of the keyboard sliding up and cover `UITextField/UITextView` without needing you to enter any extra code. To use `BHTextFieldManager` you simply need to add Framework file to your project.
